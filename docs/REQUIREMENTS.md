## 1. Purpose and scope

Recreational tennis and pickleball players in LA County cannot easily find free public courts, and cannot predict weekday-evening availability. OpenCourt LA is a map-first web tool that surfaces courts across three access tiers, scores likely availability, and lets players on the ground share live reports.

Mission: *Turning "where can I play?" into "I'm on my way."*

Out of scope for all phases: court reservations/booking, payments, coaching, equipment.

| Multi-city player | Same tool in SF / NYC / SD | 4 |

## 6. Explicit non-goals

- No user accounts before Phase 3
- No moderation queue or admin panel in Phase 2 (rate limit + recency decay is the trust model)
- No court expansion past 20 until Phase 2 backend is live
- No framework (React/Next) unless a build step becomes necessary for secret handling

---

## 7. Phase 2 deployable-backend definition (from backend thread)

A backend is "deployable" when all of the following hold:

1. Serves `courts.json`-equivalent data over HTTPS to `fetch()`
2. Accepts and persists live availability reports
3. Filters by `metro`
4. Reads < 500 ms, writes < 1 s on mobile
5. Has an abuse floor (rate limiting)
6. Survives a month untouched (managed, cheap)

Chosen stack: **Supabase** (Postgres + auto REST + RLS + free tier). Rejected: Cloudflare KV/D1 (more code), Firestore (fights normalized schema), self-hosted Node (more surface area).

Migration order: external JSON (done) → Supabase read-only `courts` → `live_reports` write endpoint → server-side aggregation view → rate limiting.

---

## 8. Acceptance criteria for v1.0.1 (this release)

- [ ] Page loads at `https://<user>.github.io/opencourt-la/` with no console errors
- [ ] All 20 markers visible on first frame without manual zoom
- [ ] Each filter chip changes list, markers, and stats together
- [ ] Clicking a report button on a public court flips its status immediately and survives a reload
- [ ] Header pill reads "Next: Australian Open" (through 2027-01-17)
- [ ] Maps key is restricted in Cloud Console; `git log -p` shows no other secrets
